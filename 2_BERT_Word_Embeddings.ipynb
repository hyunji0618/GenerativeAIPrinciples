    "2018 was a breakthrough year in NLP. \n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning, particularly models like Allen AI's ELMO, OpenAI's Open-GPT, and Google's BERT allowed researchers to smash multiple benchmarks with minimal task-specific fine-tuning and provided the rest of the NLP community with pretrained models that could easily (with less data and less compute time) be fine-tuned and implemented to produce state-of-the-art results."

    "### What is BERT?\n",
    "\n",
    "**BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** is a method of pretraining language representations that was used to create models that we can then download and use for free. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can either use these models to extract high quality language features from your text data, or you can fine-tune these models on a specific task (classification, entity recognition, question answering, etc.) with your own data to produce predictions.\n"

   "source": [
    "### Why BERT embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT can be used to **extract features, namely word and sentence embedding vectors, from text data**. What can we do with these word and sentence embedding vectors? \n",
    "\n",
    "First, these embeddings are useful for `keyword/search expansion, semantic search and information retrieval`. For example, if you want to match customer questions or searches against already answered questions or well documented searches, these representations will help you accurately retrieve results matching the customer's intent and contextual meaning, even if there's no keyword or phrase overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, and perhaps more importantly, these vectors are used as `high-quality feature inputs to downstream models`. NLP models such as LSTMs or CNNs require inputs in the form of numerical vectors, and this typically means translating features like the vocabulary and parts of speech into numerical representations. In the past, words have been represented either as uniquely indexed values (one-hot encoding), or more helpfully as neural word embeddings where vocabulary words are matched against the fixed-length feature embeddings that result from models like Word2Vec or Fasttext. BERT offers an advantage over models like Word2Vec, because while each word has a fixed representation under Word2Vec regardless of the context within which the word appears, **BERT produces word representations that are dynamically informed by the words around them**. For example, given two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"The man was accused of robbing a bank.\"\n",
    "- \"The man went fishing by the bank of the river.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec would produce the same word embedding for the word \"bank\" in both sentences, while under BERT the word embedding for \"bank\" would be different for each sentence. Aside from capturing obvious differences, the **context-informed word embeddings** capture other forms of information that result in more accurate feature representations, which in turn results in better model performance."

Han experimented with different approaches to combining these embeddings, and shared some conclusions and rationale on the [FAQ page](https://github.com/hanxiao/bert-as-service#speech_balloon-faq) of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "`bert-as-service`, by default, uses the outputs from the **second-to-last layer** of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would summarize Han's perspective by the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The embeddings start out in the first layer as having no contextual information (i.e., the meaning of the initial 'bank' embedding isn't specific to river bank or financial bank).\n",
    "2. As the embeddings move deeper into the network, they pick up more and more contextual information with each layer.\n",
    "3. As you approach the final layer, however, you start picking up information that is specific to BERT's pre-training tasks (the \"Masked Language Model\" (MLM) and \"Next Sentence Prediction\" (NSP)).\n",
    "    * What we want is embeddings that encode the word meaning well...\n",
    "    * BERT is motivated to do this, but it is also motivated to encode anything else that would help it determine what a missing word is (MLM), or whether the second sentence came after the first (NSP).\n",
    "4. The second-to-last layer is what Han settled on as a reasonable sweet-spot.\n",
